## Tech Stack

- **React 19** + **Vite 7**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin)
- **Groq API** — LLM text generation and vision
- **Pollinations.ai** — Image generation (free, no account required)
- **canvas-confetti** — Celebration animation on first recipe
- **is.gd** — Free URL shortening for scannable QR codes (no API key required)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

(`--legacy-peer-deps` is required due to a peer dependency conflict between `canvas-confetti` and React 19.)

### 2. Set up API keys

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
VITE_POLLINATIONS_API_KEY=your_pollinations_api_key
```

Get a free Groq API key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). The Pollinations key is optional but gives higher rate limits — get one at [enter.pollinations.ai](https://enter.pollinations.ai).

### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The project deploys automatically to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` via GitHub Actions.

Add `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` and `VITE_POLLINATIONS_API_KEY` as repository secrets — both are wired into the build step in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

The `base` in `vite.config.js` is set to `/AutoChef/` — update this to match your repository name exactly (GitHub Pages is case-sensitive).
